'''Quartiles basically allow allow us to divide our data points and identify the spread 
in our data.

Interquartile range, or IQR: itâ€™s the distance between the first quartile and the third quartile.
The IQR is useful in calculating outliers. Any data value that is more than 1.5 times the IQR away 
from that central 50% group is called an outlier.
